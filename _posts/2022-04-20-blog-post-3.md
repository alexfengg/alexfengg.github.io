## Light-weighted conda installer

[**miniforge**](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) is the community (conda-forge) driven minimalistic `conda` installer. Subsequent package installations come thus from `conda-forge` channel.

[**miniconda**](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) is the Anaconda (company) driven minimalistic `conda` installer. Subsequent package installations come from the `anaconda` channels (default or otherwise).

## Installing Jupyter Notebook

The goal here is to install Jupyter Notebook in the base environment and be able to switch among sub-environments.

### (base)

```commandline
conda install -c conda-forge notebook
conda install -c conda-forge nb_conda_kernels
```

<g>**nb_conda_kernels** </g>: enables a Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab application in one conda environment to access kernels for Python, R, and other languages found in other environments.

Any other environments you wish to access in your notebooks must have an appropriate kernel package installed. For instance, to access a Python environment in `env_1`, it must have the ipykernel package in (env_1)

### (env_1)

```commandline
conda install -n python_env ipykernel
```

<g>**jupyter_contrib_nbextensions** </g>: Jupyter Notebook extensions, which support a lot of autocompletion, additional information, etc.

```commandline
conda install -c conda-forge jupyter_contrib_nbextensions
```
